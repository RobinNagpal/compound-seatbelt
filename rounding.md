The scenatios we want to solve for

## 1) Defactor
const number1 = 2210000000000000000000000000;
const number2 = .000000000000000000221;
const number3 = 221000000000000000000000000.00000000000000000022;

with decimals as 18, 12, and 6

## 2) Factor
const number1 = 2210000000000000000000000000;
const number2 = .000000000000000000221;
const number3 = 221000000000000000000000000.00000000000000000022;

with decimals as 18, 12, and 6

## 3) Difference of two numbers
const number1 = 2210000000000000000000000000;
const number1_1 = 1210000000000000000000000000;


const number2 = .000000000000000000221;
const number2_1 = .000000000000000000121;

const number3 = 221000000000000000000000000.00000000000000000022;
const number3_1 = 121000000000000000000000000.00000000000000000012;

## 4) Addition of two numbers
const number1 = 2210000000000000000000000000;
const number1_1 = 1210000000000000000000000000;


const number2 = .000000000000000000221;
const number2_1 = .000000000000000000121;

const number3 = 221000000000000000000000000.00000000000000000022;
const number3_1 = 121000000000000000000000000.00000000000000000012;
